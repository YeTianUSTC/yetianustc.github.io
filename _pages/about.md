<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a (last year) **graduate student** at the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (I will graduate in **June 2024**), and my advisor is [***IEEE/ACM Fellow*** **Prof. Xiang-Yang Li**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JURtNb0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I received my bachelor's degree from Northwest Agriculture and Forestry University in 2021 with Outstanding Graduate Honors. I won the Tang Lixin Scholarship ÔºàTop 1%Ôºâand the honor of the top 10 scientific research Stars among the 100 campus Stars of the whole university.

My current research interests mainly lie in human-computer interaction, as well as mobile and ubiquitous computing, e.g., using ubiquitous wearable sensors to design advanced HCI interfaces. Our core aim is to empower objects to go beyond existing interaction types to address our real-world needs in specific scenarios. Therefore, I'm also broadly interested in the cross-application of these innovations in other areas. Recently, we designed a lip-reading-based authentication system (**BackLip**, **IWQoS 2023**) and a gesture-interactive mobile system on a smartwatch (**Mudra**, **INFOCOM 2022**) that combines the advantages of visual and IMU signal. We also cared about some of the needs in smart health and designed a silent speech interface, which can help those with hearing loss and speech impairments to communicate by recognizing what they lip-read. It can also extend voice assistants to those with limitations. This study is under revision review by **ACM IMWUT 2023**. Some other studies are under review, e.g., **MobiCom 2024**, **INFOCOM 2024**, etc. In these studies, I'm very honored to work with some outstanding professors, especially [***IEEE Fellow*** **Prof. Yusheng Ji**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3EK_RaQAAAAJ&hl=en) (NII), **[Prof. ChenrenXu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IFX5C-cAAAAJ&hl=en)** (Peking University), Assistant Prof. Haohua Du, **[Prof. Hao Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JMfB4CIAAAAJ&hl=en)** and **[Prof. Jiahui Hou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z2gblvQAAAAJ&hl=en)** (USTC).

In my undergraduate years, I was a member of the laboratory co-led by **[Prof. Yong Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zuhod6sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)** and **[Prof. Bingyi Kang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VIEDOvoAAAAJ&hl=en)**. We mainly focus on human-centered computing, especially in making decisions in uncertain environments. Under their guidance, I have achieved many exciting results. They were published in the top journals in the field, including **IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems**, **Applied Soft Computing**, and so on. I am very happy that these works have received a lot of attention and praise from other peers, including [the member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Sciences and ***IEEE Life Fellow*** **Prof. Witold Pedrycz**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0nrcfZwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), whom I greatly admire.¬† We were collaborated on the design of a decision-making framework. It is under revision review in **Expert Systems with Application**, a top journal in this field.

- User authentication is essential for threat defense and data protection. Existed authentication systems have some known limitations, such as spoofing attacks, privacy leakage, and user-unfriendliness. In this paper, we propose BackLip, a novel anti-spoofing authentication system based on lip reading. We employ Wi-Fi backscatter-based technology to recognize users lip reading due to its various advantages, e.g, privacy protection, low power consumption, and low cost. Our system is touch-free and passphrase-independent, making it user-friendly. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BackLip has an good accuracy and can maintain stability and robustness under different experimental settings. In June of this year, I reported this research in <u>Orlando, USA</u> and I am grateful to TPC chairs for inviting me to serve as a **session chair**.

- I collaborated with Kaiwen Guo and Wangqiu Zhou on a work that uses smartwatch to authenticate users and recognize gestures. It is based on multimodal information and combines the advantages of vision and IMU signaling. We carefully design a parallel attention multi-task model for different modals, and fuse classification results at the decision level with an adaptive weight adjustment algorithm. We implement a prototype of Mudra and extensive experiments demonstrate that Mudra can achieve good performance. This research was supervised by **[IEEE/ACM Fellow Prof. Xiang-Yang Li](IEEE/ACM Fellow Prof. Xiang-Yang Li)**, **[IEEE Fellow Prof. Yusheng Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3EK_RaQAAAAJ&hl=en)**  and **[Prof. Hao Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JMfB4CIAAAAJ&hl=en)**, which is published in the top conference INFOCOM 2022.

- In the information fusion process, how to effectively take care of the ambiguity and uncertainty of data is a fascinating problem. In this paper, we proposed a new information fusion method based on Dempster Shafer theory (DST) and K-means clustering and we established the reliability evaluation criterion based on Z-number. Comparison and discussion illustrates the method has better robustness and sensitivity than existing methods, some critical issues in DST, e.g., conflict management, evidence stuck, are well investigated and overcome by the proposed method. Number examples and the application further shows the application potential of the proposed method in a data-driven intelligent system. This work has published in **Applied Soft Computing (IF 8.263)**, which is a top journals in this field.

**4.A multi-attribute group decision-making method**,**[[PDF]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0952197621000725)**

- Prof.Zadeh proposed the concept of the Z-numbers, this more anthropomorphic fuzzy set representation framework describes the simultaneous existence of probability measures and probability measures of random variables, and it is regarded as a very powerful tool for modeling uncertain information. However, the representation of Z-numbers still has limitations. Therefore, we propose a new extended Z-numbers, Z = ((A ,B ),E), E is the credibility. As the objective reliability of (A , B), it restricts the original Z-numbers. At the same time, the conversion function between them is also defined. Based on this, we proposed a multi-attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method considering the attitudes of decision-makers. Application examples show the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed methodology, and the superiority of this method is further illustrated through comparison and discussion with other methods. This work has published in **Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence (If 7.802)**.

- Decision making is based on information, but information can be unreliable. We mainly consider how to make optimal decisions based on uncertain data. In this paper, we proposed a soft likelihood function based on a Z-number, which was more robust and sensibility to handle the decision problem. It provided a theoretical method for the expert system to effectively deal with the ambiguity and unreliability of information. Then, we constructed an expert decision system according to the proposed method. The application examples showed the effectiveness and rationality of the method. Moreover, the decision-making system had introduced attitude characteristics to determine the weight vector of the OWA synthesis so that the final result of the decision-making system takes into account the attitude of the decision maker. This study has published in **IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems (IF 12.253)**, which is a top journals in this field.
