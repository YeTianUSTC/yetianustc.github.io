<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a **graduate student** at the [School of Computer Science and Technology](http://cs.ustc.edu.cn/main.htm), [University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) (I will graduate in **June 2024**), and my advisor is [***IEEE/ACM Fellow*** **Prof. Xiang-Yang Li**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JURtNb0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am very thankful to Prof. Xiang-Yang Li for his continuous guidance and he encouragement me to apply for a PhD position. Previously, I received my bachelor's degree from Northwest A&F University, which is also one of the 39 "985" universities in China.  

During my time at the university, I was a member of the laboratory co-led by **[Prof. Yong Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zuhod6sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)** and **[Prof. Binyi Kang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VIEDOvoAAAAJ&hl=en)**. They opened my eyes to research, guided me to do meaningful research and always gave me confidence. I am very grateful to them! They are not only my advisors but also my friends. Until today, I still often share with them the difficulties and gains I have encountered in my research. They guided me to mainly focus on human-centered computing, especially in  making decisions in uncertain environments. Under their guidance , I have achieved many exciting results. They were published in the top journals in the field, including ***IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems***, ***Applied Soft Computing***, and so on. Here is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=P3hRr2wAAAAJ) homepage. I am very happy that these works have received a lot of attention and praise from other peers, including [the member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Sciences and ***IEEE Life Fellow*** **Prof. Witold Pedrycz**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0nrcfZwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), whom I greatly admire.¬† We are collaborating on the design of a decision-making framework. Looking forward to the good news!

During the graduate period, my study was mainly carried out under the guidance of **[Prof.Xiang-Yang Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JURtNb0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)**. I would also like to thank a number of collaborators in these studies, especially [***IEEE Fellow*** **Prof. Yusheng Ji**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3EK_RaQAAAAJ&hl=en) (NII),  **[Prof. ChenrenXu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IFX5C-cAAAAJ&hl=en)** (Peking University), **[Prof. Hao Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JMfB4CIAAAAJ&hl=en)** and **[Prof. Jiahui Hou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z2gblvQAAAAJ&hl=en)** (USTC). My main research interests are in **Human-Computer Interaction**, **Mobile Computing** and **Ubiquitous Computing**. Some of our papers have been published in top conferences such as ***INFOCOM 2022***, ***IWQoS 2023*** , etc., and some of our studies are <u>under revision or review</u> in ***UbiComp (ACM IMWUT) 2023***, ***MobiCom 2024***, ***INFOCOM 2024***, etc. 

Besides study and research, I also like music, traveling, hiking, painting, etc. A lot of my friends like to play with me, they think I am a ‚Äúhappy maker‚Äù, haha~ Anyway, if you wish to communicate with me, please feel free to email me! (<u>tianyecs@mail.ustc.edu.cn</u>, <u>tianyenwsuaf@163.com</u>) I'm happy to discuss interesting things with everyone!

- Considering the limitations of some current authentication mechanisms, such as the privacy issues caused by face recognition and voiceprint recognition. We utilize wireless technical means to authenticate users' identities through their silent lip-reading. As it combines the user's physical and behavioral characteristics, it is difficult to imitate and can better resist replay attacks. Moreover, it protects the user's sensitive image and voice data. .
