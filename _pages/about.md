<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a **graduate student** at the School of Computer Science and Technology, University of Science and Technology of China (I will graduate in **June 2024**), and my advisor is [***IEEE/ACM Fellow*** **Prof. Xiang-Yang Li**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JURtNb0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I am very thankful to Prof. Xiang-Yang Li for his continuous guidance and he encouragement me to apply for a PhD position. Previously, I received my bachelor's degree from Northwest A&F University, which is also one of the 39 "985" universities in China. 

During my time at the university, I was a member of the laboratory co-led by **[Prof. Yong Deng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Zuhod6sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)** and **[Prof. Bingyi Kang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VIEDOvoAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)**. They opened my eyes to research, guided me to do meaningful research and always gave me confidence. I am very grateful to them! They are not only my advisors but also my friends. Until today, I still often share with them the difficulties and gains I have encountered in my research. They guided me to mainly focus on human-centered computing, especially in  making decisions in uncertain environments. Under their guidance , I have achieved many exciting results. They were published in the top journals in the field, including ***IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems***, ***Applied Soft Computing***, and so on. Here is my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=P3hRr2wAAAAJ) homepage. I am very happy that these works have received a lot of attention and praise from other peers, including [the member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Sciences and ***IEEE Life Fellow*** **Prof. Witold Pedrycz**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0nrcfZwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), whom I greatly admire.¬† We are collaborating on the design of a decision-making framework. Looking forward to the good news!

During the graduate period, my study was mainly carried out under the guidance of Prof.Xiang-Yang Li. I would also like to thank a number of collaborators in these studies, especially [***IEEE Fellow*** **Prof. Yusheng Ji**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=3EK_RaQAAAAJ&hl=en) (NII),  **[Prof. ChenrenXu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IFX5C-cAAAAJ&hl=en)** (Peking University), **[Prof. Hao Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=JMfB4CIAAAAJ&hl=en)** and **[Prof. Jiahui Hou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z2gblvQAAAAJ&hl=en)** (USTC). My main research interests are in **Human-Computer Interaction**, **Mobile Computing** and **Ubiquitous Computing**. Some of our research has been published in top conferences such as ***INFOCOM 2022***, ***IWQoS 2023*** , etc., and some of our work is <u>under revision or review</u> in ***UbiComp (ACM IMWUT) 2023***, ***MobiCom 2024***, ***INFOCOM 2024***, etc.  

My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>).
